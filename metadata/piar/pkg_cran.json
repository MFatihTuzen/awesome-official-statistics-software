These indexes can then be chained\ntogether to form a time series that gives the evolution of prices with\nrespect to a fixed base period. This package contains a collections of\nfunctions that revolve around this work flow, making it easy to build\nstandard price indexes, and implement the methods described by\nBalk (2008, ISBN:978-1-107-40496-0), von der Lippe (2001,\nISBN:3-8246-0638-0), and the CPI manual (2020, ISBN:978-1-51354-298-0)\nfor bilateral price indexes.","Depends":{"R":">= 4.0"},"Imports":{"stats":"*","utils":"*","gpindex":">= 0.5.0","Matrix":">= 1.5-0"},"Suggests":{"rmarkdown":"*","knitr":"*","sps":"*","testthat":">= 3.0.0"},"License":"MIT + file LICENSE","Encoding":"UTF-8","URL":"https://marberts.github.io/piar/, https://github.com/marberts/piar","BugReports":"https://github.com/marberts/piar/issues","LazyData":"true","VignetteBuilder":"knitr","Config/testthat/edition":"3","RoxygenNote":"7.3.1","NeedsCompilation":"no","Packaged":"2024-03-08 15:41:36 UTC; steve","Author":"Steve Martin [aut, cre, cph] (<https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2544-9480>)","Maintainer":"Steve Martin <marberts@protonmail.com>","Repository":"CRAN","Date/Publication":"2024-03-08 17:30:02 UTC","crandb_file_date":"2024-03-08 19:02:45","MD5sum":"3e8dbc9ece5a540c027324e8b349a7b5","date":"2024-03-08T16:30:02+00:00","releases":[]}
