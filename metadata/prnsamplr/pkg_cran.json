A solution\nto the problem of unknown overlap between survey samples, which leads to a\nlow precision in estimates when the survey is repeated or combined with\nother surveys. The PRN solution is to supply the U(0, 1) random numbers to\nthe sampling procedure, instead of having the sampling procedure generate\nthem. In Lindblom (2014) <doi:10.2478/jos-2014-0047>, and therein cited\npapers, it is shown how this is carried out and how it improves the\nestimates. This package supports two common fixed-size sampling procedures\n(simple random sampling and probability-proportional-to-size sampling) and\nincludes a function for transforming the PRN's in order to control the\nsample overlap.","License":"MIT + file LICENSE","Encoding":"UTF-8","LazyData":"true","RoxygenNote":"7.3.2","Depends":{"R":">= 4.2"},"Imports":{"rlang":">= 1.1.0","stats":">= 4.2"},"Suggests":{"data.table":">= 1.0.0","stringr":">= 1.4.0","testthat":">=\n3.0.0","tibble":">= 3.0.0"},"Config/testthat/edition":"3","NeedsCompilation":"no","Packaged":"2024-11-20 12:48:55 UTC; kira","Author":"Kira Coder Gylling [aut, cre] (<https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9070-8381>)","Repository":"CRAN","Date/Publication":"2024-11-20 13:00:02 UTC","crandb_file_date":"2024-11-20 13:06:02","MD5sum":"bf1fde912e04cbc03ad64a82495af3fb","date":"2024-11-20T12:00:02+00:00","releases":[]}
