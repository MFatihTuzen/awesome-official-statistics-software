A solution to the\nproblem of unknown overlap between survey samples, which leads to a low\nprecision in estimates when the survey is repeated or combined with other\nsurveys. The PRN solution is to supply the U(0, 1) random numbers to the\nsampling procedure, instead of having the sampling procedure generate them.\nIn Lindblom (2014) <doi:10.2478/jos-2014-0047>, and therein cited articles,\nit is shown how this is carried out and how it improves the estimates. This\npackage supports two common fixed-size sampling procedures (simple random\nsampling and probability-proportional-to-size sampling) and includes a\nfunction for transforming the PRN's in order to control the sample overlap.","License":"MIT + file LICENSE","Encoding":"UTF-8","RoxygenNote":"6.1.1","Depends":{"R":">= 2.10"},"Imports":{"stats":"*"},"LazyData":"true","NeedsCompilation":"no","Packaged":"2023-03-08 08:57:20 UTC; kira","Repository":"CRAN","Date/Publication":"2023-03-08 11:00:02 UTC","crandb_file_date":"2023-03-08 11:57:26","MD5sum":"df05316c9a40e4a2851901b61723475d","date":"2023-03-08T10:00:02+00:00","releases":[]}
