I: Methods and Applications; vol. II: Theory. 1953, New York: John Wiley and Sons), variance estimation for longitudinal, cross-sectional measures and measures of change for single and multistage stage cluster sampling designs (Berger, Y. G., 2015, <doi:10.1111/rssa.12116>). Several other precision measures are derived - standard error, the coefficient of variation, the margin of error, confidence interval, design effect.","URL":"https://csblatvia.github.io/vardpoor/,\nhttps://github.com/CSBLatvia/vardpoor/","BugReports":"https://github.com/CSBLatvia/vardpoor/issues/","License":"EUPL | file LICENSE","Encoding":"UTF-8","Language":"en-GB","Repository":"CRAN","NeedsCompilation":"no","LazyData":"true","RoxygenNote":"7.1.1","Packaged":"2020-11-30 08:47:33 UTC; MLiberts","Author":"Juris Breidaks [aut],\nMartins Liberts [aut, cre],\nSanta Ivanova [aut],\nAleksis Jursevskis [ctb],\nAnthony Damico [ctb],\nCentral Statistical Bureau of Latvia [cph, fnd]","Maintainer":"Martins Liberts <martins.liberts@csb.gov.lv>","Date/Publication":"2020-11-30 10:00:03 UTC","crandb_file_date":"2020-11-30 11:08:38","MD5sum":"3d7b018fd366ee66741fe1c0e5e29743","date":"2020-11-30T09:00:03+00:00","releases":[]}
