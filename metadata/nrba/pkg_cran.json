Such data may arise from a complex\nsampling design with features such as stratification, clustering, or\nunequal probabilities of selection. Multiple types of analyses may be\nconducted: comparisons of response rates across subgroups; comparisons\nof estimates before and after weighting adjustments; comparisons of\nsample-based estimates to external population totals; tests of\nsystematic differences in covariate means between respondents\nand full samples; tests of independence between response status\nand covariates; and modeling of outcomes and response status as a\nfunction of covariates. Extensive documentation and references are\nprovided for each type of analysis.
