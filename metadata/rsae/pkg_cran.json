The model can be fitted by maximum likelihood or a (robust)\nM-estimator. Mean square prediction error is computed by a parametric\nbootstrap.","License":"GPL-3","URL":"https://github.com/tobiasschoch/rsae","BugReports":"https://github.com/tobiasschoch/rsae/issues","Encoding":"UTF-8","NeedsCompilation":"yes","LazyData":"true","Depends":{"R":">= 3.5.0"},"Imports":{"stats":"*","graphics":"*"},"Suggests":{"knitr":"*","rmarkdown":"*","robustbase":"*"},"VignetteBuilder":"knitr, rmarkdown","Packaged":"2024-02-06 18:46:57 UTC; tobias","Author":"Tobias Schoch [aut, cre] (<https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1640-3395>),\nBurkardt John [cph] (Fortran 90 subroutine zero_rc)","Maintainer":"Tobias Schoch <tobias.schoch@fhnw.ch>","Repository":"CRAN","Date/Publication":"2024-02-06 19:00:02 UTC","crandb_file_date":"2024-02-06 19:45:21","MD5sum":"a5bf4583c13786702342088d51175484","date":"2024-02-06T18:00:02+00:00","releases":[]}
