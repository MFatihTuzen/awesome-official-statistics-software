The constraints can be defined using the 'validate' package.\nThe core algorithms have recently been moved to the 'lintools' package,\nrefer to 'lintools' for a more basic interface and access to a version\nof the algorithm that works with sparse matrices.","Version":"0.2.8","Depends":{"R":">= 2.13.0"},"Imports":{"graphics":"*","stats":"*","validate":"*","lintools":"*"},"Suggests":{"editrules":"*","tinytest":"*"},"URL":"https://github.com/markvanderloo/rspa","BugReports":"https://github.com/markvanderloo/rspa/issues","RoxygenNote":"7.2.1","Encoding":"UTF-8","NeedsCompilation":"yes","Packaged":"2022-12-22 09:46:27 UTC; mark","Repository":"CRAN","Date/Publication":"2022-12-22 10:00:02 UTC","crandb_file_date":"2022-12-22 11:08:38","MD5sum":"8af718284fdd0de31dd07e61730d7862","date":"2022-12-22T09:00:02+00:00","releases":[]}
