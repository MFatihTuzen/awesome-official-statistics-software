Contains functions for sample size calculation for survey samples using stratified or clustered one-, two-, and three-stage sample designs, and single-stage audit sample designs. Functions are included that will group geographic units accounting for distances apart and measures of size. Other functions compute variance components for multistage designs and sample sizes in two-phase designs. A number of example data sets are included.","Suggests":{"doBy":"*","foreign":"*","lpSolve":"*","markdown":"*","plyr":"*","pps":"*","Rcpp":"*","reshape":"*","roxygen2":"*","sampling":"*","samplingbook":"*","sp":"*","survey":"*","knitr":"*","rmarkdown":"*"},"Depends":{"R":">= 3.5.0"},"Imports":{"dplyr":"*","geosphere":"*","ggplot2":"*","graphics":"*","usmap":"*"},"License":"GPL-3","LazyLoad":"yes","LazyData":"true","VignetteBuilder":"knitr","RoxygenNote":"7.1.2","NeedsCompilation":"no","Packaged":"2024-06-24 19:56:26 UTC; rv","Repository":"CRAN","Date/Publication":"2024-06-24 20:30:02 UTC","crandb_file_date":"2024-06-24 20:49:25","MD5sum":"af72daa8767cc25679b00a63c9a523ec","date":"2024-06-24T19:30:02+00:00","releases":[]}
