A suggestion is\nto start by working with functions SuppressSmallCounts() and\nSuppressDominantCells(). These functions use primary suppression functions for\nthe minimum frequency rule and the dominance rule, respectively. Novel\nfunctionality for suppression of disclosive cells is also included. General\nprimary suppression functions can be supplied as input to the general working\nhorse function, GaussSuppressionFromData(). Suppressed frequencies can be\nreplaced by synthetic decimal numbers as described in\nLangsrud (2019) <doi:10.1007/s11222-018-9848-9>.","License":"MIT + file LICENSE","URL":"https://github.com/statisticsnorway/ssb-gausssuppression","BugReports":"https://github.com/statisticsnorway/ssb-gausssuppression/issues","Encoding":"UTF-8","RoxygenNote":"7.3.1","Suggests":{"formattable":"*","kableExtra":"*","knitr":"*","rmarkdown":"*","testthat":">=\n3.0.0","lpSolve":"*","Rsymphony":"*","Rglpk":"*","slam":"*","highs":"*"},"Config/testthat/edition":"3","VignetteBuilder":"knitr","NeedsCompilation":"no","Packaged":"2024-06-28 08:56:07 UTC; oyl","Author":"Øyvind Langsrud [aut, cre] (<https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1380-4396>),\nDaniel Lupp [aut] (<https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3575-1691>),\nHege Bøvelstad [ctb],\nVidar Norstein Klungre [rev],\nStatistics Norway [cph]","Repository":"CRAN","Date/Publication":"2024-06-28 09:20:09 UTC","crandb_file_date":"2024-06-28 09:49:18","MD5sum":"4bb183b439a0daffbbba2ee8f42d233e","date":"2024-06-28T08:20:09+00:00","releases":[]}
