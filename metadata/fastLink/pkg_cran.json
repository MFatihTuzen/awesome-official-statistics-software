This includes functionalities to conduct a merge of two\ndatasets under the Fellegi-Sunter model using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. In addition,\ntools for preparing, adjusting, and summarizing data merges are included. The package implements methods\ndescribed in Enamorado, Fifield, and Imai (2019) ''Using a Probabilistic Model to Assist Merging of\nLarge-scale Administrative Records'' <doi:10.1017/S0003055418000783> and is available\nat <https://imai.fas.harvard.edu/research/linkage.html>.","License":"GPL (>= 3)","Imports":{"Matrix":"*","parallel":"*","foreach":"*","doParallel":"*","gtools":"*","data.table":"*","stringdist":"*","stringr":"*","stringi":"*","Rcpp":">= 0.12.7","adagio":"*","dplyr":"*","plotrix":"*","grDevices":"*","graphics":"*","methods":"*"},"Depends":{"R":">= 2.14.0"},"LinkingTo":{"RcppArmadillo":"*","Rcpp":"*","RcppEigen":"*"},"Encoding":"UTF-8","LazyData":"true","BugReports":"https://github.com/kosukeimai/fastLink/issues","RoxygenNote":"7.2.2","Suggests":{"testthat":"*"},"NeedsCompilation":"yes","Packaged":"2023-11-17 06:16:45 UTC; tedenamorado","Author":"Ted Enamorado [aut, cre],\nBen Fifield [aut],\nKosuke Imai [aut]","Maintainer":"Ted Enamorado <ted.enamorado@gmail.com>","Repository":"CRAN","Date/Publication":"2023-11-17 08:00:02 UTC","crandb_file_date":"2023-11-17 09:39:23","MD5sum":"5bb74a18f8b582aa0ed024a934bacf76","date":"2023-11-17T07:00:02+00:00","releases":[]}
