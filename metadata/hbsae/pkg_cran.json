The model is fit using restricted maximum likelihood, or\nin a hierarchical Bayesian way. In the latter case numerical integration is\nused to average over the posterior density for the between-area variance.\nThe output includes the model fit, small area estimates and corresponding\nmean squared errors, as well as some model selection measures. Additional functions\nprovide means to compute aggregate estimates and mean squared errors, to minimally\nadjust the small area estimates to benchmarks at a higher aggregation\nlevel, and to graphically compare different sets of small area estimates.","Date":"2022-03-03","Depends":{"R":">= 2.15.2"},"Imports":{"Matrix":"*","methods":"*"},"Suggests":{"mcmcsae":"*","survey":"*","knitr":"*","hypergeo":"*","testthat":"*"},"RoxygenNote":"7.1.2","NeedsCompilation":"no","Packaged":"2022-03-04 20:06:23 UTC; hbta","Author":"Harm Jan Boonstra [aut, cre]","Maintainer":"Harm Jan Boonstra <hjboonstra@gmail.com>","Repository":"CRAN","Date/Publication":"2022-03-05 15:40:13 UTC","crandb_file_date":"2022-03-05 16:56:44","MD5sum":"01c77d2935e8142fdfb465c2f2f1d176","date":"2022-03-05T14:40:13+00:00","releases":[]}
