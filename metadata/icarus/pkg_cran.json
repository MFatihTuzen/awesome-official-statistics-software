{"Package":"icarus","Title":"Calibrates and Reweights Units in Samples","Description":"Provides user-friendly tools for calibration in survey sampling.\nThe package is production-oriented, and its interface is inspired by the famous\npopular macro 'Calmar' for SAS, so that 'Calmar' users can quickly get used to\n'icarus'. In addition to calibration (with linear, raking and logit methods),\n'icarus' features functions for calibration on tight bounds and penalized\ncalibration.","Version":"0.3.2","Authors@R":"c(person(\"Antoine Rebecq\", role=c(\"aut\",\"cre\"),\nemail = \"antoine.rebecq@m4x.org\"))","Maintainer":"Antoine Rebecq <antoine.rebecq@m4x.org>","Depends":{"R":">= 3.1.1"},"License":"GPL-3","LazyData":"true","Suggests":{"testthat":"*","ggplot2":"*","Rglpk":"*","slam":"*","xtable":"*","magrittr":"*"},"RoxygenNote":"7.2.3","Encoding":"UTF-8","NeedsCompilation":"no","Packaged":"2023-05-27 01:03:07 UTC; rharoine2","Author":"Antoine Rebecq [aut, cre]","Repository":"CRAN","Date/Publication":"2023-05-27 04:10:02 UTC","crandb_file_date":"2023-05-27 06:03:25","MD5sum":"4417b09018cec991f7bb7a123808caf7","date":"2023-05-27T03:10:02+00:00","releases":[]}
