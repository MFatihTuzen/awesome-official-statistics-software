The calibration for totals is based on Deville and Särndal (1992) <doi:10.1080/01621459.1992.10475217>, the calibration for quantiles is based on Harms and Duchesne (2006) <https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/12-001-X20060019255>. The package uses standard calibration via the 'survey', 'sampling' or 'laeken' packages. In addition, entropy balancing via the 'ebal' package and empirical likelihood based on codes from Wu (2005) <https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/12-001-x/2005002/article/9051-eng.pdf> can be used.
